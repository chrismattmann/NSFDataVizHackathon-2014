Dear NSF DataViz Hackathon for Polar CyberInfrastructure Participants,

Thank you for your patience as the meeting organization has really
been coming together!

We have just emailed today information to those that requested
travel support for the meeting - so if you did request support and
haven¹t received our contact, please do let us know.

The meeting is now 18 days away and will be here before you know
it!

The logistics are really coming together on the website:

http://nsf-polar-cyberinfrastructure.github.io/datavis-hackathon/

New information available:

1. Suggested hotel logistics (use information to book your hotel
to get New School¹s rate) 
2. Parking information and information
on how to get to New school 
3. A draft agenda (that will be updated
likely a few times over the next week or so) 
4. Proposed sessions
are coming in (more on this later!) and there is information on the
website for how you should submit a session.

We are asking everyone on this list to *please confirm no later
than Monday October 20th, 2014* your participation in this meeting.
You can do so simply by sending an email to nsfdatavis@gmail.com
with the subject line:

[NSF DataViz Hackathon] Confirm participation of <Your First Name
Your Last Name> where <Your First Name Your Last Name> if you were
me would be Chris Mattmann and the full subject line would be:

[NSF DataViz Hackathon] Confirm participation of Chris Mattmann


We would like to publish a list of participants on the website by
Monday and we require your confirmation before publishing that list.

Speaking of sessions, here¹s how you can get involved!

0. Register for Github and get an account if you don¹t already have
one: https://github.com/join

1. If you have data, code, or a visualization (or some subset of
those three), please first read the sessions already present. They
are visible on the website under the heading ³Sessions², which you
can find from the left hand navigation bar (click on the 3 stacked
line bars in the upper left of the page to get the menu, then click
on Sessions). If your idea falls under one of the existing sessions,
please start commenting and interacting there. The organizers and
leads will appreciate your contributions and ideas. We¹ll use this
both leading up to; during; and after the workshop to stay in touch.
If you don¹t see a session there, please see these instructions for
submitting a new session:
https://github.com/NSF-Polar-Cyberinfrastructure/datavis-hackathon/wiki


2. Begin collaborating with your other participants in the proposed
session. Expose your data to them. Discuss what you are going to
visualize.  Talk about the technologies and tools. All of these
things will be your interaction points and will help to ensure there
is a clear and well defined goal when you guys hit the ground running
at the hackathon in a few weeks in NYC. If you aren¹t sure what to
do, comment that.  If you need one of the other participants to
check your code out, link it to them. Some of the existing sessions
are already talking about and sharing data as well.

3. Get social - use Twitter and Hash Tag #nsfpolardatavis to start
tweeting to your network to get people excited and commenting about
the event.  Talk about it on Facebook or Instagram or Google Plus.
Jump into IRC on irc://irc.freenode.net/#nsfpolardatavis and start
meeting some of the folks you are going to be hacking and data-vizzing
with.  Instructions for using IRC are here:

4. Show up to the workshop ready to get a little technical, but to
also provide key science input into the meeting. This hackathon was
envisioned as a meeting of the minds between CI people and Polar
people, and is a meant as one of the natural follow ons from last
year¹s very successful NSF Polar CyberInfrastructure workshop at
the Polar Geospatial Center. In addition, we are drawing and borrowing
from experience at the NSF funded Open Science Codefest and other
recent hackathon activities that we have been organized in. The
more you put in the more we all will collectively get out of this.

Finally please keep watching the website and comment if there is
any question that you aren¹t sure of, or if you simply want to reach
out. Github is our first place, or you may also email any of the
organizing committee, myself, and/or use one of the many other
communication mediums (Twitter, IRC, etc.)

Thank you and we will be providing regular information updates as
they are available. Thank you all and looking forward to a successful
workshop!

Cheers, 
Chris 
(on behalf of the organizing committee)
