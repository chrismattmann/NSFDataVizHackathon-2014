Dear NSF DataViz Hackathon for Polar CyberInfrastructure Participants,

I wanted to provide those of you that requested travel support an update
on some recent decisions I’ve made as the PI with input from the organizing 
committee:

1. We will provide a federal per diem of $53.25 per travel day (75% of the 
regular GSA per diem for that time/place in NYC), and a per deim
of $41 for dinner and incidental expenses for each day of your participation in 
the meeting (2 days). We will be providing lunch and breakfast coffee and light  
snacks on both meeting days.

2. We will work to cover federal per diem on hotels for NYC of $304/night

If there are specific corner cases to the above, please coordinate with me
directly, and I will loop in our admin from USC, Daisy Tang, CC’ed, to help.

Thank you and looking forward to your participation in the meeting!

Cheers,
Chris
