Dear NSF DataViz Hackathon for Polar Cyber Infrastructure Participants,

We have a request from one of the participants to use a personal
voice recorder to perform audio recording. The purpose of the
recording is to facilitate sharing experience of the event with the
participantâ€™s team after the event and the audio files will not be
shared with anyone outside the team. There is also a request from
the same participant to audio record brief interviews with some
participants of the event.

Please reply to me (chris.a.mattmann@nasa.gov) if there are any
specific objections to this request.

Thank you and looking forward to the event!

Cheers, Chris
