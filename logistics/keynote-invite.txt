Dear <Keynote Person>,

<Person> suggested I get in touch with you. I’m organizing an NSF
sponsored workshop for DataViz hacking in the Polar CyberInfrastructure
domain, funded by Dr. Marco Tedesco, the NSF program manager. I’m CC’ing
him and some members of our organizing committee on this email.

Would you be interested in giving a keynote talk at the meeting?
It takes place November 3-4, 2014 (yes a few weeks away!) at Parsons
New School for Design.

I’m thinking something like 25-30 mins, and then maybe 5-10 mins
for question and answer? Would that be something you are interested in?
We have a website here with more information about the workshop:

http://nsf-polar-cyberinfrastructure.github.io/datavis-hackathon/

The TL;DR of it: the workshop will bring together CyberInfrastructure (CI)
people, Polar people, data visualization people, and we are using Github
to organize the whole thing leading up to, during, and after the workshop.
The code will be Apache Licensed, version 2 (“ALv2”), along with the 
produced visualizations, and the data used. All of it will remain open
and the hacking will produce results that will serve as “recipes” or cook-books
for the NSF to look at in terms of what types of technologies, approaches,
and philosophies it should be funding in this area. It will also be a 
great opportunity to meet people and network. The setting is intimate,
and New School is amazing and a great venue. 

Please let me know what you think. Apologies for the short notice and
thanks for replying as soon as you can.

Cheers,
Chris
